A Maven Build Lifecycle is Made Up of Phases.,
    Validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
    Compile - compile the source code of the project
    Test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
    Package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
    Verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
    Install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    Deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
