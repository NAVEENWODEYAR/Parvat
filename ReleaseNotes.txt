Docker,
 Docker is one of the few websites that reflect system dark themes by default, which was a good surprise.
 The notes are detailed and are linked to further information, allowing people to consume data as per need.
 Since late 2021, the summary added at the beginning provides details on what changes have been carried out and how users are impacted in plain language.

 What to emulate: The organization is top-notch, and the help sections allow users to understand challenging terms. They provide a varying level of detail without overwhelming users. The use of alerts is wisely done too.
 What to avoid: The notes are clearly labeled and organized, leaving little room for shortcomings. The structure of the notes can get a bit monotonous â€“ as if the team is trying to tick all boxes of a checklist.
