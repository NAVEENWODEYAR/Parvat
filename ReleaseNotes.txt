Docker,
 Docker is one of the few websites that reflect system dark themes by default, which was a good surprise.

 What to emulate: The organization is top-notch, and the help sections allow users to understand challenging terms. They provide a varying level of detail without overwhelming users. The use of alerts is wisely done too.
 What to avoid: The notes are clearly labeled and organized, leaving little room for shortcomings. The structure of the notes can get a bit monotonous â€“ as if the team is trying to tick all boxes of a checklist.
